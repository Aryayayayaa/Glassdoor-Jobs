# Glassdoor-Jobs
Using 2017 Glassdoor data, this project predicts tech salaries based on job title, company size, and location. It provides valuable insights for job seekers, employers, and recruiters, helping them understand compensation trends and make informed decisions.

### Project Description

This project performs time series analysis on FBI crime data to identify and forecast trends over time. Using historical crime data, the project aims to uncover patterns in specific crime types, such as theft, assault, or homicide. The analysis leverages the "Description" field in the dataset to provide a granular understanding of crime trends. For instance, it can differentiate between "Retail Theft" and "Theft of Motor Vehicle," allowing for more precise insights into crime patterns.

### Key Features and Goals

* **Granular Analysis:** Focuses on the **Description** field to analyze specific crime subtypes, providing a richer, more detailed understanding of crime trends than broad categories alone.
* **Time Series Modeling:** Utilizes various time series models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to forecast future crime rates for specific crime subtypes.
* **Data Visualization:** Generates visualizations (e.g., plots, heatmaps) to illustrate crime trends, seasonal patterns, and forecast results.
* **Reproducible Research:** Provides a clear, step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the analysis, including data sources, dependencies, and code.
